            What is Loreum Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum, sometimes referred to as 'lipsum', is the placeholder text used in design when creating
            content.

            Why do we use it?
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
            using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
